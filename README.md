null steered beamforming for microphone arrays

To run the code, you can run:
1. mvdr_vs_lcmv.m in file "Chap3": compare the mvdr and lcmv beamformer on beam pattern, spectrogram and corresponding speech waveforms of the relevant signals
2. main.m in file "Chap4": complete LCMV beamformer using frame-based signal processing method, including the fixed-data-independent approach and data-dependent approach
3. ADI.m in file "Chap4": the adaptive-data-independent lcmv, where the steering vector is assumed unknown
4. conversation.m and dynamic_pattern.m in file "Chap5": simulation of dynamic beam pattern varying with time, and the simulation of two talker conversation scenario.
5. RUNMe.m in file "Chap6": frequency independent beamformer
6. any .m file in file "draft", where is some draft codes about DSB, MVDR, LCMV (may not work)
